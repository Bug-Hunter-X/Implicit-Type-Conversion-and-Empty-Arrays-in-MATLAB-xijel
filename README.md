# Implicit Type Conversion and Empty Arrays in MATLAB

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion and the handling of empty arrays.  When a function returns an empty array, the calling function might not anticipate this and therefore can lead to unexpected errors.

## Bug Description
The `bug.m` file showcases a function that returns an empty array under a specific condition.  If the calling code does not explicitly check for an empty array, it can result in unexpected runtime errors or incorrect behavior.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.m` file presents a corrected version of the function, which provides robust handling of potential empty array returns and prevents the aforementioned error.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.m` and `bugSolution.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run `bug.m` to observe the error.
4. Run `bugSolution.m` to see the corrected version of the function.
